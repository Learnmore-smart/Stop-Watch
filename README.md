Hey everyone! I'm excited to share my latest coding project - a Stop Watch!

It's my fourth website, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.

You can check it out here: https://learnmore-smart.github.io/Stop-Watch/

Here's what I learned this time:

I figured out a cool way to make the start button "useless" once the Stop Watch is running.

I also used a "lighter" effect to make the title look a little nicer.

I used centisecondsElapsed as variable instead of secondsElapsed, so it could display centiseconds on the screen.



I hope you like it! It could be helpful for studying or just tracking time, maybe even wasting time.

Enjoy~
